###[Steve Dudek](http://https://github.com/stevedudek) 
Steve is a life-long chemist taking a year diversion from DNA sequencing to build and install art. He makes LED wearables that have vague animal shapes (like the one shown) that he programs with microcontrollers. When not making hats, Steve runs long distances, travels to far away places, and write a video game about a prudent penguin. Find the small beginning of his code work on github: [stevedudek] (https://github.com/stevedudek)

###[Julia Janicki](http://juliajanicki.com) - 
I am a conservation biologist/ entomologist in training and have a background in studying languages, but I've always loved art and design, and I picked up programming and GIS/cartography on the side. Now one of my favorite things to do is to make interactive maps.  I also love animals (I have 2 bearded dragons) and I love rock climbing. As well as film photography and video editing.
